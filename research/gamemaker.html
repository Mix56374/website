            <div><dt><span>Founded:</span></dt><dd><span>November 15th, 1999</span></dd></div>

        <div><dt><span>Learning Curve</span></dt><dd><span>GameMaker is the simplest to learn and understand, because of its simple visual coding language, that allows users to make games with no prior coding experience. It also has a lot of online resources such as tutorials and documentation to pull from.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Resources for Learning</span></dt><dd><span>Official Documentation: <a href="https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameMaker Docs</a><br>Official Tutorials: <a href="https://gamemaker.io/tutorials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameMaker Tutorials</a><br>Beginner's Guide: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBCDzE9MDbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video</a></span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Cost</span></dt><dd><span>There are three tiers of pricing: the free tier gives access to all features, with a non-commercial licence; the professional tier is a one time purchase of $100 and additionally grants the user a commercial licence; and the enterprise tier is a subscription of $80 a month, or $800 a year, which grants the user a commercial license, console exports, and source code access.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Platform Deployment</span></dt><dd><span>Users can export to all desktop systems, any web formats, and most mobile devices using any tier, but can additionally export to consoles with the enterprise tier subscription.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Community and Resources</span></dt><dd><span>There are many online resources such as the official documentation and tutorials made by the community. There is also a marketplace that features community made tools and assets.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Recommendations by Experience Level</span></dt><dd><span>Easiest to get started for users who have little to no experience with coding, but can also scale in order to make more complex games.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Comparison to Class Tools</span></dt><dd><span>GameMaker does many things better than Game Lab, but some that really stand out are the differences in visual coding solutions and game deployment. Visual coding in Lab only consists of turning code into blocks, while GameMaker turns code into a blueprint style display to systematically link blocks together. For game deployment in Game Lab, all you can do is copy the link to the project on the web, while GameMaker allows you to export your game to almost any platform.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>What Surprised Me Most</span></dt><dd><span>I was surprised by how many popular indie games were made in GameMaker. I knew about some of them, such as Undertale and Deltarune, but I had no idea that games like Forager, Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain, Spelunky and others were made in GameMaker. This showed to me that GameMaker could definitely be used for higher level games, and the visual coding portion was not bottlenecking the rest of the engine.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Conclusion</span></dt><dd><span>GameMaker allows for creation of simple or complex 2D games using either the visual coding language, typed language, or a mixture of both.</span></dd></div>

          <p><span>GameMaker has a similar interface to Godot, with one major difference being how it can only support 2D games.</span></p>
