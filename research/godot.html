        <div><dt><span>Learning Curve</span></dt><dd><span>Godot is pretty straightforward to learn if the user has any coding experience since it is based on languages like Python and Lua. There are also a lot of good resources and tutorials available to help learn if the user has no prior knowledge.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Resources for Learning</span></dt><dd><span>Official Documentation: <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction</a><br>Resource to learn from zero: <a href="https://www.gdquest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.gdquest.com</a><br>Learn how to make 3 games Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLG2yVpLDT8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLG2yVpLDT8</a></span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Cost</span></dt><dd><span>Free and open source.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Platform Deployment</span></dt><dd><span>Users can export to Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Web, and VRs like Meta Quest.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Community and Resources</span></dt><dd><span>There are many online tutorials and guides for developers to start and understand the basics of Godot. The official documentation is also regularly updated and easy to browse for explanation of features. There is also an asset library that includes many free assets or plugins to help in the game development process.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Recommendations by Experience Level</span></dt><dd><span>The language is very easy to pick up for users who have experience in languages like Python or Lua. All of the different features might be hard to understand, but can eventually be used for high level games.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Comparison to Class Tools</span></dt><dd><span>Godot has many more features than Game Lab, such as 3D support, much better performance, a lot more versatility in the types of games you can make, the types of collision tools, quality of life features, and much more.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>What Surprised Me Most</span></dt><dd><span>Godot was a lot more user friendly than I had initially thought, for example I was initially confused and lost when trying to navigate the UI and write code. However, after taking some time to get used to the UI and realizing that the language was very similar to others I had previously worked in, I was surprised by how easy it was to pick up.</span></dd></div>
        <div><dt><span>Conclusion</span></dt><dd><span>Godot allows for quick prototyping of potential 2D or 3D games, while leaving enough room to eventually develop them into full games.</span></dd></div>
